	<h1>Hi there, I'm Ben Nelson!</h1>
	<p>I am a Data Science Scholar at the Center for Interdisciplinary and Exploratory Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) at Northwestern University. I received my PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics at The Pennsylvania State University in 2015 and my MSc in Astronomy at University of Florida in 2011. I received my BS in Physics (Astrophysics) at UC Santa Cruz in 2009. My main research interests lie at the intersection of (mainly Bayesian) statistical methods and (mainly the orbital dynamics of) exoplanet systems.</p>
