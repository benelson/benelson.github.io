    <h3>Exoplanets and Planet Formation</h3>
    <div id="TEXT">
       <p>Astronomers have confirmed the existence of
       <a href="http://exoplanets.org/">more than 700 planets</a>
       outside of our own solar system (called
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasolar_planet">extrasolar planets or exoplanets</a>)
       orbiting nearby stars like our Sun in our own Galaxy.  Many of the
       systems are completely unlike our own solar system though, and our
       improved understanding of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebular_hypothesis#Formation_of_planets">how planets form</a>
       has been greatly influenced by the new discoveries.  Most of the
       differences between our own solar system and the known exoplanets are
       due to the fact that the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_extrasolar_planets">ways</a>
       that we find exoplanets are not perfect -- they're much, much better
       at finding massive planets like Jupiter that are closer to their host
       stars than Earth is to the Sun, and much, much worse at finding
       planets like Earth.  Still, there is enormous diversity in the
       exoplanet population of our Galaxy, and a general theory of planet
       formation should explain them all.</p>

       <p>I'm playing a small role in the effort to better
       understand the properties of the exoplanet population
       and to use those properties to improve our understanding
       of planet formation.  My research has been featured in <a

    <h3>Bayesian Methods for Parameter Estimation and Model Comparison</h3>
    <div id="TEXT">
       <p>Like all other upper middle-class galaxies, our own
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_way">Milky Way Galaxy</a>
       has been
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_formation_and_evolution#The_formation_of_disk_galaxies">built-up</a>
       through the acquisition of more stuff: more gas, more stars, and more
       dark matter.  Some of the gas and the dark matter continuously stream
       into our own Galaxy from the space between galaxies -- this is not the
       case for the stars though, as stars can only form in galaxies.  Now,
       most of the stars in our own Galaxy are natives that formed here;
       however, there is a population of stars that have compositions and
       orbits seemingly unlike the stars native to our own Galaxy.  These
       stars potentially formed in smaller galaxies that our Galaxy has
       gravitational acquired and torn asunder over the past 10 billion
       years.  At the same time, they might also be very atypical stars that
       are nevertheless native to the Milky Way.  Either way, they're
       valuable finds that can provide insight into the formation of our
       Galaxy and into the characteristics of the universe billions of years
       ago in a way that no other population of stars can.  Unfortunately,
       trying to find rare stars like these in our Galaxy is like trying to
       find needles in a haystack.</p>

       <p>Even though these special stars are hard to find, there is hope.
       Certain special properties of the way that the orbits of stars change
       over time due to the mutual gravitational interactions between those
       stars can cause the special stars to stand out.  Once they're
       identified as such, further study of those special stars can reveal a
       lot about the environments in which they formed.</p>

       <p>For my PhD dissertation, I found some of those special stars.
       The properties of the stars allowed me to figure out what type
       of galaxy they came from, even though that galaxy was eaten by
       our own Milky Way 5 billion years ago!  I'm currently working
       to find the most ancient stars in the Galaxy that are currently
       closest to the Sun. Ancient stars are typically found far away
       from the Sun in the outskirts of the Galaxy, so it's import to
       find them in the vicinity of the Sun so that we can study them
       in detail.</p>
