   <h2>Non-Academic Projects</h2>
    <p>When I'm not doing astrophysics, I have various data science related side projects.</p>
    <h3>STEM penpals: using data science to connect students with scientists</h3>
    <div id="TEXT">
       <p><a href="http://www.prescientist.org/">Letters to a Pre-Scientist</a> is a non-profit penpal program designed to connect grade school students from underrepresented backgrounds in science to real scientists across the nation.
          Every year, they work to match hundreds of students and scientists with varying science interests.
          I lead an effort to build a matching pipeline, using student and scientist survey data and pair them based on interests and enthusiasm.
          This led to a factor of <em>~1,000,000</em> speedup over LPS' manual matching.
          Read more about it on <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/discussion/stem-penpals-connecting-students-scientists">Edutopia</a> and the Letters to a Prescientist <a href="http://www.prescientist.org/2017/10/12/hackinglps/">blog</a>.

    <h3>Effects of grain orientation on brace deflection in acoustic guitars</h3>
    <div id="TEXT">
       <p>Common wisdom in the <a href="http://www.luth.org/">luthier</a> community is that quartersawn material (i.e., wooden boards with grain perpendicular to the faces) is typically stiffer than plainsawn (i.e., boards with grain parallel to the faces).
          Is this true for wooden braces in acoustic guitars?
          We gathered wood samples of various types and cuts and tested this theory.

   <h3>Astronomy on Tap - Chicago</h3>
    <div id="TEXT">
       <p> I'm a "host star" for the Chicago chapter of Astronomy on Tap.
          The idea behind these events is that handful of astronomers from Northwestern University or University of Chicago will take over a bar for a night and give a public astronomy talk, along with trivia prizes, and science demos.
          Check us out on <a href="https://twitter.com/aotchicago">social</a> <a href="https://facebook.com/aotchicago">media</a> or read about our events in the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-eclipse-expectations-met-20170820-story.html">Chicago Tribune.</a> </p>
