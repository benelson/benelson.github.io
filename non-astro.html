    <h3>STEM penpals: using data science to connect students with scientists</h3>
    <div id="TEXT">
       <p><a href="http://www.prescientist.org/">Letters to a Prescientist</a> is a non-profit penpal program designed to connect grade school students from underrepresented backgrounds in science to real scientists across the nation.
          Every year, they work to match hundreds of students and scientists with varying science interests.
          I lead an effort to build a matching pipeline, using student and scientist survey data and pair them based on interests and enthusiasm.
          This led to a factor of <em>10^6</em> speedup over their manual matching.
          Read more about it on <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/discussion/stem-penpals-connecting-students-scientists">Edutopia</a> and the Letters to a Prescientist <a href="http://www.prescientist.org/2017/10/12/hackinglps/">blog</a>.

   <h3>Astronomy on Tap - Chicago</h3>
    <div id="TEXT">
       <p> I'm a "host star" for the Chicago chapter of Astronomy on Tap.
          A handful of graduate students, postdocs, and/or professors from Northwestern University or University of Chicago will take over a bar for a night and give public astronomy talks, along with trivia, demos, and prizes.
